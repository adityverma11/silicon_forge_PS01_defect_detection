ONNX Model Usage

The trained MobileNetV3-Small model was exported from PyTorch to
ONNX format for interoperability and deployment readiness.

The ONNX model was used as the input artifact for verification
using the NXP eIQ Toolkit.

No architectural changes were made during the ONNX export process.
