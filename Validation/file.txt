Model Validation 

The trained model was evaluated using a separate validation and test split of the SEM image dataset.

Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy and class-wise precision and recall.

A confusion matrix was generated to analyze class-level prediction performance and misclassification patterns.

Test Accuracy: 83 %
Precision: 84
Recall: 82
Average latency per image: 72 ms (CPU)
